In this section, we will setup our Red Hat Openshift environment. We will:
 
- Set up an Red Hat Openshift account if one doesn't already exist.
- Configure the Red Hat Openshift Cloud Shell.
- Download the workshop code.
- Create the AKS cluster. 

Please choose if you are running the workshop on your own or attending an Red Hat Openshift event.
