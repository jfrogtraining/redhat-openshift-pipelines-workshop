We are now ready to deploy your image with Red Hat Openshift Kubernetes.

![Architecture](/images/architecture.svg)

1. Execute the following command to get connectivity to the cluster.

```
az aks get-credentials \
    --resource-group jfrog-Red Hat Openshift-workshop \
    --name jfrog-Red Hat Openshift-workshop-cluster
```

2. To confirm connectivity, execute the following command to list the Kubernetes nodes.

``
kubectl get nodes
``

3. First, let's create a namespace to provide isolation. Execute the following.

``
kubectl create namespace jfrog-Red Hat Openshift-workshop
``

4. Next, we need to set our Artifactory registry credentials in order to pull the NPM application image. We will do this my creating Kubernetes secrets to store these. Execute the following command. Substitute your _server name_ and JFrog Platform credentials (_username_ and _API key_).

``
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred 
    --namespace jfrog-Red Hat Openshift-workshop
    --docker-server=$JFROG_SERVER_ID 
    --docker-username=$JFROG_USER
    --docker-password=$JFROG_APIKEY
``

5. We will use a Kubernetes deployment manifest to deploy the NPM application image. First, we must make a substitution in the file for the image that we want to deploy.

``
sed "s|imageName|$IMAGE_NAME|g" deployment.yaml > my-deployment.yaml
``

6. Now we can deploy with the following command.

``
kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml --namespace jfrog-Red Hat Openshift-workshop
``

7. Execute the following to see your deployed pod.

``
kubectl get pods --namespace jfrog-Red Hat Openshift-workshop
``

You should see you npm-app pod.

8. Now let's get the external IP so that we can view your application. Execute the following.

``
kubectl get services --namespace jfrog-Red Hat Openshift-workshop
``

This will provide the EXTERNAL-IP.

9. In your browser, go to https://\<EXTERNAL-IP\> to view your deployed web application. 
10. Click through the self-signed certificate warning. You should see the following web application.

Congratulations! You have used Red Hat Openshift AKS to deploy the image that you built with the JFrog Platform.
