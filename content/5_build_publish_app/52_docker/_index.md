We will now build a Docker image with our NPM package and publish the image to our JFrog Artifactory repository.

![JFrog CLI Docker](/images/jfrog-cli-docker.svg)

1. In your Red Hat Openshift Cloud Shell. Let's create a Docker image for our NPM application. Let's create an environment variable for our image name. Substitute your _server name_ in the following command.

```
export IMAGE_NAME=${JFROG_SERVER_ID}/docker-demo/npm-app:latest
echo $IMAGE_NAME
```

2. Now let's build a docker image with the following command.

``
docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME .
``

This command should result in a successful Docker image build.

Docker Hub has set a new limit on data transfer beginning November 1st for free accounts: 100 pulls for anonymous users and 200 pulls for authenticated/free users for every 6 hours per IP address or a unique user.

Artifactory can protect you from this by proxying and caching images! This reduces the number of pulls from Docker Hub.

Docker also has a 6 month retention policy for free accounts. You can avoid that as well by using Artifactory as your private registry.

3. Now use the JFrog CLI to push the docker image.

``
jfrog rt docker-push $IMAGE_NAME docker-demo --build-name=npm_build --build-number=1
``

4. Now trigger a Xray scan of the build.

``
jfrog rt build-scan npm_build 1
``

This command should result in successful scanning.

5. If our build passes the Xray scan, we can promote it with the following command. This promotes from the _dev_ repository to the _prod_ repository.

``
jfrog rt docker-promote npm-app docker-demo-dev-local docker-demo-prod-local --copy
``

6. In your JFrog Platform instance, go to **Artifactory** â–º **Artifacts** to see this in the docker repositories.
